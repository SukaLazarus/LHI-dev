Jesus appeared to Reverend Kenneth Hagin eight times over the next several years in visions that changed the course of his ministry. 
            Reverend Hagin married his wife Oretha Rooker On November 25, 1938. They had two children. Their first child Kenneth Wayne Hagin, known as Kenneth Hagin Jr., was born on September 3, 1939. A daughter, Patricia (Hagin) Harrison, was born 19 months later on March 27, 1941.His son Kenneth Wayne Hagin is currently the pastor of Rhema Bible Church and President of Kenneth Hagin Ministries.
         </p> Mark 11:23-24 defined his ministry and was his most frequently quoted verse:
           <br><i>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, <br/>be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea, shall not doubt in his heart,<br/>but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have <br/>whatsoever,he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that<br/> ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</i>
